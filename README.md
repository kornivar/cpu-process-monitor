# cpu-process-monitor
A Python tool to monitor system processes based on CPU usage.  Currently, it logs processes with low CPU usage, ignoring system and popular applications  (e.g., Chrome, Teams, Python). The logs are stored in the “logs” folder in a file with the date of logging. Future updates will include monitoring processes with sudden spikes in CPU usage.
